# NeetCode 150 Challenge

## 🚀 Why This Repo Exists
This repository is where I document my journey through the **NeetCode 150 Challenge**, a collection of **must-know** coding problems for technical interviews. The goal? To get better at problem-solving, understand key patterns, and build confidence in tackling **LeetCode-style** questions.

If you're also grinding through these problems, feel free to check out my solutions and compare approaches! 👨‍💻🔥

## 📌 What's Covered?
The problems are divided into essential **DSA categories**, making it easier to focus on one topic at a time:
- 🧩 **Arrays & Hashing**
- 🔄 **Two Pointers**
- 🔍 **Sliding Window**
- 📚 **Stack & Queues**
- 🎯 **Binary Search**
- 🔗 **Linked List**
- 🌳 **Trees & Graphs**
- 🏗 **Dynamic Programming**
- 💡 **Greedy & Intervals**
- ➗ **Math & Bit Manipulation**

Each problem has its own solution file, and I’ll add explanations where needed.

## 📂 How This Repo Is Structured
